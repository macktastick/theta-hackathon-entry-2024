# What It Does

WWZ is a Discord game for PFP NFTs. Players choose an NFT from their existing collection to fight on their behalf in automated, text-based combat.

## Summer 2024 Enhancements

### Community vs. Community matches

For the first time, one NFT Community can challenge another to a WWZ match &mdash; even across blockchains. Since we refer to WWZ-enabled Discord servers as `Gyms` (like a Pok√©mon or martial arts gym), we call this new game format `Gym-vs-Gym`.

This video shows gameplay of a hypothetical [Order of the Tigons](https://www.orderofthetigons.com/) vs [ThetaZillaClub](https://thetazillaclub.com/) match.

### Community leagues

The new cross-community game format launched with support for organized league play. Communities play against other Communities for bragging rights and possibly prizes while game results are tracked against a league leaderboard.

Our goal for this feature is to support Web3's version of something like a volleyball or softball league in Web3.

### On-Chain, In-Game Cosmetics

Players have the option to wear a skin in-game. We first introduced this feature in December 2023. As part of our Summer Release, these skins are now NFTs on the Theta Blockchain. 

To date, these cosmetics have been earned by attending or winning special WWZ events (such as our PvP tournament described below). Thanks to help from OpenTheta, players may also [buy and sell these rewards](https://opentheta.io/collection/awards). 

### Automated TFUEL Play-to-Earn Rewards

We are demonstrating automated TFUEL play-to-earn rewards in the #free-for-all channel of our Discord. For now, players are earning TFUEL in the following ways:

* Winning a match earns `X` TFUEL where `X` is the number of players in the match
* Defeating a player with a Bounty earns `Y` TFUEL where `Y` varies as a function of `X` depending on bounty severity

### Inaugural Player-vs-Player Open Tournament

We included new features to support or first organized PvP Tournament in mid-June.
