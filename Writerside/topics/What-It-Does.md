# What It Does

WWZ is a [Discord](https://discord.com) game for supported profile picture (PFP) NFTs. Players choose and train a PFP from their existing collection to fight on their behalf in automated, text-based combat that can be surprisingly fun.

### New for Summer 2024

#### Community vs. Community matches

For the first time, one NFT Community can challenge another to a WWZ match&mdash;even across blockchains. Full write-up available in [v0.11 Patch Notes](https://www.notion.so/wwzgame/v0-11-RKO-e2f2ab93aa50472f882ed80f6c1aa6d4).

#### Community leagues

Web3 communities can now play against peer communities in organized leagues. Game results are tracked against league leaderboards. For more, see the full [v0.11 Patch Notes](https://www.notion.so/wwzgame/v0-11-RKO-e2f2ab93aa50472f882ed80f6c1aa6d4).


#### On-Chain, In-Game Cosmetics

We first introduced in-game skins in [January 2024](https://www.notion.so/wwzgame/v0-9-Frankensteiner-da05074e3f3e47fca811d5b7080f1a99). As part of our Summer Release, these skins are now NFTs on the Theta Blockchain.

To date, these cosmetics have been earned by attending or winning special WWZ events. Thanks to help from [OpenTheta](https://opentheta.io/), players may also [buy and sell these rewards](https://opentheta.io/collection/awards).

#### Automated TFUEL/TNT20 Rewards

The game is capable of rewarding players with TFUEL or TN20 tokens in the following ways:

* Winning a match earns `X` TFUEL/TNT20 where `X` is the number of players in the match
* Defeating a player with a bounty earns `Y` TFUEL/TNT20 where `Y` varies as a function of `X` depending on bounty severity
