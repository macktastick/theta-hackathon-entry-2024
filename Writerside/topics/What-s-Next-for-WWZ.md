# What&apos;s Next for WWZ?

### Gym Network Expansion

We intend to steadily grow the WWZ gym network. To date, we have prioritized Discord servers bound to NFT communities, but any Web3 Discord server is a candidate. For example, we would love to put a WWZ gym in the ThetaNetwork and OpenTheta Discord servers where members could use any eligible Theta NFT to play and represent each server in cross-community play.

### Community League Play

We plan to launch our first league in Q3 2024. We intend to start with relatively small leagues and short short seasons and grow them as we add expand the Gym Network.

### Partner Rewards Integration

We would like to integrate token based rewards (eg. TDROP, KFUEL, POG, TVIBE). 

We have demonstrated the game can technically do this now with the [Theta Blockchain JS SDK](https://docs.thetatoken.org/docs/theta-js-sdk-overview), but we are currently in the process of selecting a partner for KYC/AML services. 

On the technical side, we have integrated two prospective services. We hope to have finalized partner selection in August 2024. 

### Auditable Game Results

We are interested in exploring writing near-live game data on-chain. Ideally, this would include some form of on-chain randomness as well. We are only in the discovery phase here, but believe it to be an important capability going forward.
