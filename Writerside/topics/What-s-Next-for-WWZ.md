# What&apos;s Next for WWZ?

### Gym Network Expansion

We intend to steadily grow the WWZ gym network. To date, we have prioritized Discord servers bound to NFT communities, but any Web3 Discord server is a candidate. For example, we would love to put a WWZ gym in the ThetaNetwork and OpenTheta Discord servers where members could use any eligible Theta NFT to play and represent each server in cross-community play.

### Community League Play

We plan to launch our first league in Q3 2024. We intend to start with relatively small leagues and short short seasons and grow them as we add expand the Gym Network.

### Partner Rewards Integration

We are currently demonstrating automated TFUEL-based P2E capabilities, but intend to expand this to include TNT-20 token based rewards.

### Auditable Game Results

We are interested in exploring writing near-live game data on-chain. Ideally, this would include some form of on-chain randomness as well.
