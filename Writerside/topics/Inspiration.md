# Inspiration

WWZ is a Web3 game that began as an [entry to the 2023 Theta Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/wwz). We enjoyed participating and are proud of what we accomplished, but want to take the project further.

This year, we are submitting a major new release that includes:

* Cross-community, cross-chain gameplay
* Organized Leagues
* On-Chain, In-Game Cosmetics
* Automated TFUEL Play-to-Earn Rewards

With this update and the included League support, we believe WWZ can become to Web3 communities what pickleball or softball leagues are to the off-chain world.
