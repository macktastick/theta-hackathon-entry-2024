# Inspiration

WWZ is a Web3 game that began as an [entry to the 2023 Theta Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/wwz). We enjoyed participating and are proud of what we accomplished, but want to take the project further.

This year, we are submitting a major new release that includes:

* Cross-community, cross-chain gameplay
* Organized Leagues
* On-Chain, in-game cosmetics
* Automated TFUEL and TNT20 play-to-earn rewards

With this update, we believe WWZ can become to Web3 communities what pickleball or softball leagues are to off-chain communities.

> **Our goal is to become a touchstone for Web3 communities of all shapes and sizes&#8212;and to base that shared activity here on Theta**.
