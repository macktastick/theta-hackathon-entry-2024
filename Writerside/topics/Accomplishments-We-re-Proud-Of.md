# Accomplishments We're Proud Of

### Gym Network Growth

WWZ currently provides gaming utility:

* to [15 NFT collections](https://app.wwz.gg/collections) (6 on Theta)
* in [9 Community Discord Servers](https://app.wwz.gg/gyms) (5 on Theta)
* across 4 blockchains (with Theta as primary)
* to over 100,000 playable PFP NFTs

### Successful PvP Tournament Nᵒ 1

In early June, we [invited the WWZ community](https://twitter.com/wwzgame/status/1797956230406951205) to participate in our first organized tournament. Twenty-two players competed for a prize pool that included Theta NFTs, TFUEL, WWZ skins, and a Grand Prize of a ticket to ThetaCon 2024 provided by the [Order of the Tigons](https://www.orderofthetigons.com/).

### Ongoing Solana Expansion

On July 26th, the [g00bs NFT Community](https://g00bs.xyz/home) opened the second WWZ Gym based on a Solana collection (10th Gym overall). 

The g00bs community is already averaging close to 30 players per match - the majority of which are new to Theta.

### Simulator Results

Proving WWZ is a "skill game" is an important goal to us. So we are happy to have made progress this season with:

* a simulator capable of running relatively large volumes of games (so far tens of thousands)
* [initial simulator results](https://medium.com/@wwzgame/f0ec67d4e306) that point toward strong skill-based elements

### Popularity

On July 4th, 2024 WWZ players [trained their 100,000th combatant](https://x.com/wwzgame/status/1809248811283292536) since we began recording around the same time in 2023.
