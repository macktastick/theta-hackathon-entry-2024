## Successful PvP Tournament Náµ’ 1

In early June, we [invited the WWZ community](https://twitter.com/wwzgame/status/1797956230406951205) to participate in our first organized tournament.

Twenty-two players competed for a prize pool that included Theta NFTs, TFUEL, WWZ skins, and a Grand Prize of a ticket to ThetaCon 2024 provided by the [Order of the Tigons](https://www.orderofthetigons.com/).

## Simulator and Results

Proving that the game is a "skill game" is an important goal to us. So we are happy to have made progress this season with: 

* a simulator capable of running relatively large volumes of games (so far tens of thousands)
* [initial simulator results](https://medium.com/@wwzgame/f0ec67d4e306) that point toward strong skill-based elements
